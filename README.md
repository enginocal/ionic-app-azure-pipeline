# ionic-app-azure-pipeline

## Why I did feel the need to create this repository? 

There was a project at work at the time that was written in Ionic and had features that needed to be added.

I have never written before Ionic app, so at first i need to install environment and gave apk to our tester or colleagues. 

When i build apk everytime has occured one problem, it is always broken our effort.

After that i decided to make a pipeline. You can find other resources on the web but maybe the yaml is easy for you.
